        <dd>Yes I know for our young youth and single men and women. We find it very hard to keep our home clean at all times. That is one of the reason why Men marry women to assist them them take care of their home. Yes, i have to say that taking care of your home is not an easy task to do single handedly but with time, after you are through with this coruse you will know the better ways to do it. Vaccuming your floor is essential. Some of us ignore this responsibility of not vaccuming the floor every morning wich leads to the unfilfthy of the interior part of this house. When you come inside of a teenage room so scattered. So vaccuming our floor every morning is so important.</dd>
